# ExpensePlannerProject

This project is made with personal educational purposes. Opinions are not mine, but coded myself by referencing [education on udemy]( https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps)

Application lets you add your **transactions** with the custom **title**, **amount** and **date** attributes and demonstrates the ratio of the spent money in weekly scope(day by day).
